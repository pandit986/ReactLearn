Certainly! useCallback is a hook in React that helps you optimize your application's performance by memoizing 
(remembering) a function so that it doesn't get recreated every time your component re-renders.
 
In simpler words, it's like having a sticky note where you write down a function. With useCallback,
 this function is only rewritten when certain dependencies change, which can make your application run faster
  and use less memory.

Imagine you have a button in your component, and you want to pass a function to that button's onClick event. 
If you don't use useCallback, a new function is created every time your component renders. This can be inefficient 
if your component renders frequently.

But if you use useCallback, the function is only created when the dependencies you specify change. So, it's
 like using the same sticky note with the function written on it, and you only get a new one when you need to
  change what's written on it. This can help your application perform better.
